For my final year project I created “Scenic Spheres”, an AR/VR educational game using the Unity game development engine, utilising C# scripts. The game featured both a single player and a server based online multiplayer mode with full integration using the HTC Vive. Making use of Google Maps APIs the players are placed in various different locations around the world using Street View imagery. The player explores each area, discovers clues and answers questions whilst competing against the clock or other players. A short video demo is available:
